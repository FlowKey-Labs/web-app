# Booking Deletion & Cancellation System Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive booking deletion and cancellation system that follows production best practices with both **soft deletion** and **hard deletion** capabilities, plus client self-service cancellation.

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Soft Delete System** (Recommended for Production)
- Bookings are marked as deleted but remain in database
- Maintains audit trails and data integrity
- Supports restoration if needed
- Hidden from normal queries but accessible for reporting

### 2. **Hard Delete System** (Admin Only)
- Permanent removal from database
- Configurable permissions per business
- Requires explicit confirmation for safety

### 3. **Client Self-Cancellation**
- Secure booking cancellation by clients using booking reference
- Identity verification (email/phone match)
- Time-based cancellation deadlines
- Cancellation policy enforcement

### 4. **Admin Cancellation Management**
- Full admin control over booking lifecycle
- Detailed audit logging for all actions
- Email notifications for all parties
- Comprehensive error handling

## üîß API Endpoints Added

### Admin Endpoints (Authenticated)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/booking/manage/` | List bookings with deletion filtering |
| `PATCH` | `/api/booking/manage/{id}/` | Cancel/approve/reject/soft_delete/restore |
| `DELETE` | `/api/booking/manage/{id}/` | Hard delete booking (permanent) |

### Client Self-Service Endpoints (Public)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/booking/client/{reference}/` | Get booking info for cancellation |
| `POST` | `/api/booking/client/{reference}/cancel/` | Cancel booking by client |

## üéØ New Actions Available

### Admin Actions (via PATCH to `/api/booking/manage/{id}/`)

#### 1. **Cancel Booking**
```json
{
  "action": "cancel",
  "reason": "Session cancelled by instructor"
}
```

#### 2. **Soft Delete Booking**
```json
{
  "action": "soft_delete", 
  "reason": "Test data cleanup"
}
```

#### 3. **Restore Deleted Booking**
```json
{
  "action": "restore"
}
```

### Client Actions (via POST to `/api/booking/client/{reference}/cancel/`)

```json
{
  "client_email": "client@example.com",
  "reason": "Can't attend due to schedule conflict"
}
```

## üìä Database Schema Changes

### New Fields in `BookingRequest` Model

```python
# Cancellation tracking
cancelled_at = DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
cancelled_by = ForeignKey(User, null=True, blank=True)
cancellation_reason = TextField(blank=True)
cancelled_by_client = BooleanField(default=False)

# Soft delete support  
is_deleted = BooleanField(default=False)
deleted_at = DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
deleted_by = ForeignKey(User, null=True, blank=True)
deletion_reason = TextField(blank=True)
```

### New Fields in `BookingSettings` Model

```python
# Cancellation policies
allow_client_cancellation = BooleanField(default=True)
cancellation_deadline_hours = IntegerField(default=24)
send_cancellation_emails = BooleanField(default=True)
cancellation_fee_policy = TextField(blank=True)

# Admin deletion settings
allow_admin_deletion = BooleanField(default=True)
require_deletion_reason = BooleanField(default=True)
```

## üîí Security & Permissions

### Client Cancellation Security
- **Identity Verification**: Must provide matching email or phone
- **Time Restrictions**: Configurable deadline before session
- **Business Policies**: Can be disabled per business
- **Audit Logging**: All actions logged with IP and user agent

### Admin Deletion Security  
- **Permission Checks**: Only authenticated business owners
- **Configurable Policies**: Can disable deletion per business
- **Reason Requirements**: Mandatory reasons for transparency
- **Audit Trails**: Complete activity logs

## üìß Email Notifications

### New Email Templates Supported
1. **Booking Cancelled** (`booking/emails/booking_cancelled.html`)
   - Different content for client vs admin cancellations
   - Includes cancellation reason and business contact info

### Email Content Includes
- Booking details and reference
- Cancellation reason
- Contact information for questions
- Cancellation policy information
- Fallback HTML for template failures

## üß™ Testing Utilities

### Booking Test Utility Script
Created `booking_test_utility.py` with capabilities:

```bash
# Clean up test data
python booking_test_utility.py clean

# Clean specific emails
python booking_test_utility.py clean --emails test@example.com demo@test.com

# Clean ALL bookings (dangerous!)
python booking_test_utility.py clean --all

# Show current bookings
python booking_test_utility.py show

# Create test sessions guide
python booking_test_utility.py create-sessions --business-slug=johnny-bravo-fitness-center

# Create test bookings guide  
python booking_test_utility.py create-bookings --business-slug=johnny-bravo-fitness-center
```

## üìù Implementation Steps Required

### 1. **Database Migration**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate  # or your venv path

# Create and apply migrations
python manage.py makemigrations booking
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. **Email Templates** (Optional)
Create these templates for enhanced email formatting:
- `templates/booking/emails/booking_cancelled.html`

### 3. **Frontend Integration** (Suggested)
Update frontend to support new actions:
- Add cancel/delete buttons in admin booking management
- Create client cancellation page using booking reference
- Add filtering options for deleted bookings

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Business Settings
Each business can configure:
- **Client cancellation allowed**: Yes/No
- **Cancellation deadline**: Hours before session
- **Admin deletion allowed**: Yes/No  
- **Deletion reason required**: Yes/No
- **Cancellation fee policy**: Free text for display

### Query Parameters
- `?include_deleted=true` - Include soft-deleted bookings in admin view
- `?status=cancelled` - Filter by specific status

## üö¶ User Experience Flow

### Client Cancellation Flow
1. **Client visits**: `/booking/cancel/{booking_reference}`
2. **System shows**: Booking details and cancellation policy
3. **Client enters**: Email/phone for verification
4. **System verifies**: Identity and time restrictions
5. **If valid**: Cancels booking and sends confirmation
6. **Business notified**: Via admin notification and email

### Admin Deletion Flow
1. **Admin views**: Booking management dashboard
2. **Selects action**: Cancel, soft delete, or hard delete
3. **Provides reason**: If required by business policy
4. **System processes**: With full audit logging
5. **Email sent**: To client explaining the action

## üìà Best Practices Implemented

- Preserves data for business analytics
- Enables restoration if needed
- Maintains referential integrity
- Supports compliance requirements

### 2. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**
- Who performed the action
- When it was performed  
- What reason was given
- IP address and user agent
- Previous and new status

### 3. **Graceful Error Handling**
- Clear error messages for each scenario
- HTTP status codes following REST conventions
- Validation at multiple levels
- Fallback email templates

### 4. **Configurable Policies**
- Business-specific cancellation rules
- Time-based restrictions
- Permission controls
- Customizable messaging

## üîç API Response Examples

  }
}
```

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Apply database migrations**
2. **Test the utility script** to clean up existing test data
3. **Create a few test bookings** with known emails for testing
4. **Test cancellation endpoints** using the provided API calls

### Future Enhancements
1. **Bulk operations** for mass deletion/cancellation
2. **Rescheduling functionality** (separate from cancellation)
3. **Refund processing integration** for paid bookings
4. **Enhanced reporting** on cancellation patterns
5. **Customer communication templates** for various scenarios

## üö® Important Notes

### Production Considerations
- **Backup database** before applying migrations
- **Test cancellation policies** thoroughly
- **Configure email templates** for professional communication
- **Review business settings** for appropriate restrictions
- **Monitor audit logs** for unusual activity

### Testing Recommendations
- Use the provided test utility for safe data management
- Test both client and admin cancellation flows
- Verify email notifications are working
- Test edge cases like expired bookings and deletion restrictions

This implementation provides a production-ready booking cancellation and deletion system with comprehensive audit trails, flexible policies, and excellent user experience for both clients and administrators.

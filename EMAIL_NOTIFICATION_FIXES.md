# Email Notification Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Cancellation Email Error - ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Cancellation emails were failing with error: `send_email() got an unexpected keyword argument 'message'`

**Root Cause**: The `send_cancellation_notification()` method was using Django's `send_mail()` function signature instead of the custom `send_email()` function.

**Fix**: Updated the method to use correct signature:
```python
# Before (incorrect):
send_email(
    subject=subject,
    message="...",
    from_email=settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
    recipient_list=[to_email],
    html_message=render_to_string(template, context),
    fail_silently=False,
)

# After (correct):
html_content = render_to_string(template, context)
send_email(subject, to_email, html_content)
```

### 2. Missing Soft Deletion Email Notifications - ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: When admins soft-deleted bookings, clients received no notification, leaving them unaware their booking was removed.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ Created `send_deletion_notification()` method
- ✅ Added call to deletion notification in `BookingRequest.soft_delete()` method 
- ✅ Created professional HTML email template: `booking_deleted_client.html`
- ✅ Added comprehensive audit logging for deletion emails

### 3. Admin Email Configuration Error - ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Admin email notifications failed with error: `'BusinessProfile' object has no attribute 'email'`

**Root Cause**: Code was trying to access `business.email` when the field is actually `business.contact_email` in the BusinessProfile model.

**Fix**: Updated admin email retrieval logic to use correct fields:
```python
# Get business admin emails properly
admin_emails = []

# Add business contact email if available
if business.contact_email:
    admin_emails.append(business.contact_email)

# Add business owner email (most important)
if business.user and business.user.email:
    admin_emails.append(business.user.email)

# Get other business admin users (staff with admin roles)
try:
    from apps.users.models import User
    admin_users = User.objects.filter(
        businessprofile=business,
        is_active=True,
        role__name__icontains='admin'
    ).values_list('email', flat=True)
    admin_emails.extend(admin_users)
except:
    # If role filtering fails, just use business owner
    pass
```

### 4. Missing Admin Notifications for Client Actions - ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: When clients cancelled their own bookings, only client emails were sent - admins were not notified about the cancellation.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ Enhanced `send_cancellation_notification()` to send both client and admin emails
- ✅ Enhanced `send_reschedule_notification()` to send both client and admin emails  
- ✅ Enhanced `send_deletion_notification()` to send both client and admin emails
- ✅ Professional admin email templates for all scenarios:
  - `booking_cancelled_admin.html`
  - `booking_rescheduled_admin.html` 
  - `booking_deleted_admin.html`

### 5. Incorrect Admin Email Context - ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Admin emails were using client-focused language and addressing admins as if they were the client.

**Specific Issues Found**:
- Admin emails said "Dear {{ booking_request.client_name }}" (client's name)
- Used language like "**your booking** has been cancelled" 
- Included empathetic client-focused messaging: "we understand this may cause inconvenience"
- Wrong context entirely - admins getting client cancellation template

**Fix**: Completely rewrote admin email templates with proper business context:
```html
<!-- Before (wrong) -->
<div class="greeting">
    Dear {{ booking_request.client_name }},
</div>
<div class="message">
    <p><strong>We need to inform you that your booking has been cancelled.</strong></p>
    <p>This cancellation was processed by our team, and we understand this may cause inconvenience.</p>
</div>

<!-- After (correct) -->
<div class="header">
    <div class="admin-badge">Admin Notification</div>
    <h1 style="color: #dc3545; margin: 0;">Client Cancellation</h1>
    <p style="margin: 5px 0 0 0; color: #6c757d;">{{ business.business_name }}</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>A client has <strong class="highlight">cancelled</strong> their booking.</p>
</div>
```

**Admin-Focused Content Now Includes**:
- ✅ Professional business language ("Client Cancellation", "Admin Notification")
- ✅ Informational context (who cancelled, when, why)
- ✅ Business impact information (capacity updates, spots released)
- ✅ Next steps guidance ("No action required", "Client has been notified")
- ✅ Admin-relevant details (cancelled by client vs admin, booking reference, client contact info)

## Email Templates Created

### Client Email Templates
1. **`booking_deleted_client.html`** - Informs clients their booking was removed
2. **`booking_cancelled_client.html`** - Confirms cancellation (existing, fixed)
3. **`booking_rescheduled_client.html`** - Confirms reschedule (existing, fixed)

### Admin Email Templates  
1. **`booking_deleted_admin.html`** - Notifies admins when bookings are deleted
2. **`booking_cancelled_admin.html`** - Notifies admins when bookings are cancelled (**FIXED CONTEXT**)
3. **`booking_rescheduled_admin.html`** - Notifies admins when bookings are rescheduled

## Bidirectional Communication Implemented

### Client-Initiated Actions → Admin Notifications
- ✅ Client cancels booking → Admin gets **professional business notification**
- ✅ Client reschedules booking → Admin gets notification email  
- ✅ Client books session → Admin gets notification email (existing)

### Admin-Initiated Actions → Client Notifications  
- ✅ Admin deletes booking → Client gets notification email
- ✅ Admin cancels booking → Client gets notification email
- ✅ Admin reschedules booking → Client gets notification email
- ✅ Admin approves/rejects booking → Client gets notification email (existing)

## Email Recipients Configuration

For each business, email notifications are sent to:

### Client Emails
- `booking_request.client_email` (if available)

### Admin Emails (Multiple Recipients)
1. **Business Contact Email**: `business.contact_email`
2. **Business Owner Email**: `business.user.email` 
3. **Admin Staff Emails**: Users with admin roles in the business
